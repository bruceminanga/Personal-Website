      <p>
        Hello there! I'm incredibly passionate about technology, and my journey
        apparently began in 2020 during the memorable Corona Period. I took the
        initiative to teach myself and learned all about Linux System
        Administration, which is like being a computer expert. In 2021, I
        discovered something super cool called Python and Django, which are
        special ways of coding. Then, in 2022, I successfully completed my
        undergraduate Computer Science course. Currently, my main focus is on
        web development, where I create awesome websites. My goal is to become
        really, really good at it! I'm also excited to explore the world of
        DevSecOps, which involves protecting and strengthening digital systems.
        In my free time, I love to immerse myself in various activities such as
        Computer Repair, Problem-Solving, Teaching and doing some small projects
        for my family and friends. This helps me to continuously expand my
        knowledge and stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Lastly, I
        love Collaborating with others. I genuinely enjoy working as part of a
        team. Let's join forces and create fantastic, easy-to-use products
        together If you're looking for someone with a passion for technology.
